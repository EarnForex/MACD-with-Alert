# MACD with Alert

MACD with Alert is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It is based on the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator. It finds points where the main line crosses either the zero level or the signal line. This indicator supports all types of alerts.

The indicator draws its arrows in the main chart window while the MACD itself is displayed in the separate chart window.

It is a non-repainting indicator.
